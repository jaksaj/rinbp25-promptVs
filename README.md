# PromptVs

A powerful Prompt Engineering Workbench for systematically optimizing and testing prompts across multiple LLM providers.

## 🚀 Features

- **Multi-LLM Support**: Test prompts across various LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Hugging Face, local models)
- **A/B Testing**: Compare different prompt versions and models side by side
- **Version Control**: Track prompt evolution with graph-based versioning
- **Secure Testing**: Run prompts in isolated Daytona sandboxes
- **Performance Analytics**: Collect and analyze metrics across different prompts and models

## 🏗️ Architecture

PromptVs is built with a modern stack:

- **Frontend**: React/Next.js with a beautiful, intuitive UI
- **Backend**: FastAPI (Python) for robust API handling
- **Database**: Neo4j graph database for prompt versioning and relationships
- **Testing**: Daytona sandboxes for secure, parallel prompt execution
